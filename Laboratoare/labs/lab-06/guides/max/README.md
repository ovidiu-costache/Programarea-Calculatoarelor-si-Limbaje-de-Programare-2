# Guide: Max

To follow this guide, you'll need to use the `max.asm` file located in the `guides/max/support` directory.

The program finds the maximum value in an array of 16-bit integers (`array`).
It iterates through the array, updating the maximum value (`dx`) when it finds a larger value.
Finally, it prints the maximum value using the `printf()` function.

>**Note**: For a detailed description of the instruction, check out the following page: [Assembly Arrays Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/assembly_arrays.htm)
