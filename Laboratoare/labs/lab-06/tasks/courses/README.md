# Task: Courses

You will solve the exercises starting from the `courses.asm` file located in the `tasks/courses` directory.
Fill in the instructions to display the course in which each student is enrolled.
We will assume that each student is enrolled in at most one course.

The program's output after a correct solution should be:

Kate ---- Student unassigned :(
```

Follow the comments marked with **TODO**.
