# Task: Max

Calculate the maximum between two numbers in two registers (`eax` and `ebx`) using a comparison instruction, a jump instruction, and push/pop instructions.

> **TIP:** Consider how you can swap two registers using the stack.

## Checker

To run the checker, go into the `tests` directory located in `src`, then type `make check`.
A successful output of the checker should look like this :

```console
student@os:~/.../lab-07/tasks/gcd/max$ make && make check
test_max              ................................... passed ... 100

========================================================================

Total:                                                           100/100
```
