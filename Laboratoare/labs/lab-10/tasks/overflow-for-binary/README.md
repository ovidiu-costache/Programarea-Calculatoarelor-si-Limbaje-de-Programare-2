# Task: Buffer Overflow for Binary

Often, we don't have access to source code and want to discover vulnerabilities in executable files.
In the `tasks/overflow-for-binary/support/` directory of the laboratory resource archive, you will find an executable file.
Using `ghidra` or `gdb` for investigation, discover how to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability to make the program display the message **Great success**.

> **IMPORTANT** To run `ghidra` on the `overflow_in_binary` executable file, you need to create a new project and import the executable file.
> Ghidra will automatically detect the file format.
> Run the analysis of the executable, then search in the Symbol Tree for the `main` function.
> **HINT** Identify in the disassembled code how input is passed to the program.
> Identify where the buffer overflow occurs.
> Identify the comparison condition you want to trigger.
> Then build the corresponding payload and deliver it in the appropriate format to the program.

If you're having difficulties solving this exercise, go through [this](../../reading/overflow-vuln.md) reading material.

> **WARNING** If you try using a payload generated with python and it doesn't work, try simply copying its content in the terminal
