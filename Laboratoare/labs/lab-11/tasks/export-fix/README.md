# Task: Fixing Export Issues

Access the directory `tasks/export-fix/support/`.
Each subdirectory (`a-func/`, `b-var/`, `c-var-2/`) contains a problem related to the export of symbols (functions or variables).
In each subdirectory, run the `make` command, identify the issue, and edit the necessary files to resolve it.

If you're having difficulties solving this exercise, go through [this](../../reading/linking.md) reading material.
