# Task: Warning (not an Error)

Access the directory `tasks/include-fix/support/`.
Run the `make` command.
A warning appears, but it is from the preprocessing/compilation process.
Resolve this warning by editing the `hello.c` file.

**Bonus**: Fix the warning without using the `#include` directive.

If you're having difficulties solving this exercise, go through [this](../../reading/linking.md) reading material.
